It can be viewed as a collection of Landau levels that arise from quantization of Brown-Zak minibands recurring at rational (p/q) fractions of the magnetic flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Here we show that, in graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices, Brown-Zak fermions can exhibit mobilities above 106\,cm2\,V-1\,s-1 and the mean free path exceeding several micrometers. The exceptional quality of our devices allows us to show that Brown-Zak minibands are 4q times degenerate and all the degeneracies (spin, valley and mini-valley) can be lifted by exchange interactions below 1\,K. We also found negative bend resistance at 1/q fractions for electrical probes placed as far as several micrometers apart. The latter observation highlights the fact that Brown-Zak fermions are Bloch quasiparticles propagating in high fields along straight trajectories, just like electrons in zero field.},

  abstract = {Twisted van der Waals heterostructures with flat electronic bands have recently emerged as a platform for realizing correlated and topological states with an extraordinary degree of control and tunability. In graphene-based moir\textbackslash 'e heterostructures, the correlated phase diagram and band topology depend strongly on the number of graphene layers, their relative stacking arrangement, and details of the external environment from the encapsulating crystals. Here, we report that the system of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) hosts a variety of correlated metallic and insulating states, as well as topological magnetic states. Because of its low symmetry, the phase diagram of tMBG approximates that of twisted bilayer graphene when an applied perpendicular electric field points from the bilayer towards the monolayer graphene, or twisted double bilayer graphene when the field is reversed. In the former case, we observe correlated states which undergo an orbitally driven insulating transition above a critical perpendicular magnetic field. In the latter case, we observe the emergence of electrically tunable ferromagnetism at one-quarter filling of the conduction band, with a large associated anomalous Hall effect. Uniquely, the magnetization direction can be switched purely with electrostatic doping at zero magnetic field. Our results establish tMBG as a highly tunable platform for investigating a wide array of tunable correlated and topological states.},

  abstract = {Twisted bilayer graphene displays insulating and superconducting phases caused by exceptional flattening of its lowest energy bands. Superconductivity with highest Tc appears near half filling of the valence band (n{$\approx-$}2). The data show that in the large part of the superconducting dome near n=-2, threefold lattice rotation symmetry is broken in the superconducting phase, i.e., a superconductor is also a nematic. We perform a comprehensive analysis of superconductivity in twisted-bilayer graphene within an itinerant approach and present a mechanism for nematic superconductivity. We take as an input the fact that at dopings, where superconductivity has been observed, the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of twist-induced Van Hove singularities in the density of states. We argue that the low-energy physics can be properly described by patch models with either six or twelve Van Hove points. We obtain pairing interactions for the patch models in terms of parameters of the microscopic model for the flat bands, which contains both local and twist-induced nonlocal interactions. We show that the latter give rise to attraction in different superconducting channels. For six Van Hove points, there is just one attractive d-wave channel, and we find chiral d{$\pm$}id superconducting order, which breaks time-reversal symmetry but leaves the lattice rotation symmetry intact. For twelve Van Hove points, we find two attractive channels, g and i waves, with almost equal coupling constants. We show that both order parameters are nonzero in the ground state and explicitly demonstrate that in this co-existence state the threefold lattice rotation symmetry is broken, i.e., the superconducting state is also a nematic. We find two possible nematic states, one is time-reversal symmetric, the other additionally breaks time-reversal symmetry. We apply our scenario to twisted bilayer graphene near n=-2 and argue that it is applicable also to other systems with two (or more) attractive channels with similar couplings as our reasoning for a nematic superconductivity is based on generic symmetry considerations.},

When the bands are half-filled, we observe the development of gaps originating from correlated insulating states. Near charge neutrality, we find a previously unidentified correlated regime featuring an enhanced splitting of the flat bands. We describe this within a microscopic model that predicts a strong tendency towards nematic ordering.

  abstract = {Flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have recently emerged as a rich platform to explore strong correlations1, superconductivity2\textendash 5 and magnetism3,6,7. However, the phases of MATBG in a magnetic field and what they reveal about the zero-field phase diagram remain relatively uncharted. Here we report a rich sequence of wedge-like regions of quantized Hall conductance with Chern numbers C\,=\,{$\pm$}1, {$\pm$}2, {$\pm$}3 and {$\pm$}4, which nucleate from integer fillings of the moir\'e unit cell v\,=\,{$\pm$}3, {$\pm$}2, {$\pm$}1 and 0, respectively. We interpret these phases as spin- and valley-polarized many-body Chern insulators. The exact sequence and correspondence of the Chern numbers and filling factors suggest that these states are directly driven by electronic interactions, which specifically break the time-reversal symmetry in the system. We further study the yet unexplored higher-energy dispersive bands with a Rashba-like dispersion. The analysis of Landau-level crossings enables a parameter-free comparison to a newly derived `magic series' of level crossings in a magnetic field and provides constraints on the parameters of the Bistritzer\textendash MacDonald MATBG Hamiltonian. Overall, our data provide direct insights into the complex nature of symmetry breaking in MATBG and allow for the quantitative tests of the proposed microscopic scenarios for its electronic phases.},

In TBG, the nematic order parameter is not Ising like, as in tetragonal crystals, but has a three-state Potts character related to the threefold rotational symmetry (C3z) of the moir\'e superlattice. We find that, even in the presence of static strain that explicitly breaks the C3z symmetry, the system can still undergo a nematic-flop phase transition that spontaneously breaks in-plane twofold rotations. Moreover, elastic fluctuations, manifested as acoustic phonons, mediate a nemato-orbital coupling that ties the nematic director orientation to certain soft directions in momentum space, rendering the Potts-nematic transition mean field and first order. In contrast to the case of rigid crystals, the Fermi surface hot spots associated with these soft directions are maximally coupled to low-energy nematic fluctuations in the moir\'e superlattice case. Twisted 2D materials realize a unique electronic nematic state, quite different from its counterpart in bulk quantum materials.

We find, from numerical and analytical studies, that the scaling behavior of the total width of the spectrum and the multifractal nature of the spectrum are unchanged, provided the next-nearest-neighbor coupling terms are below a certain threshold value. The full square symmetry of the Hamiltonian is not required for criticality, but the square diagonals should remain as reflection lines. A bicritical line is found at the boundary between the region in which the nearest-neighbor terms dominate and the region in which the next-nearest-neighbor terms dominate. On the bicritical line a different critical exponent for the width of the spectrum and different multifractal behavior are found. In the region in which the next-nearest-neighbor terms dominate, the behavior is still critical if the Hamiltonian is invariant under reflection in the directions parallel to the sides of the square, but a new length scale enters, and the behavior is no longer universal but shows strongly oscillatory behavior. For a flux per unit cell equal to 1/q the measure of the spectrum is proportional to 1/q in this region, but if it is a ratio of Fibonacci numbers the measure decreases with a rather higher inverse power of the denominator.},

The structure of the secular equation is studied in detail, and the k dependence of the energy is analytically obtained. In the absence of NNN hopping, the two bands at the center touch for q even; thus the Hall conductance is not well defined at half-filling. An energy gap opens there by introducing NNN hopping. When {$\varphi$}=1/2, the NNN model coincides with the mean-field Hamiltonian for the chiral spin state proposed by Wen, Wilczek, and Zee [Phys. Rev. B 39, 11 413 (1989)].

  abstract = {An effective single-band Hamiltonian representing a crystal electron in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding form of a Bloch band by replacing {$\hslash\rightarrow$}k by the operator \textrightarrow p-e\textrightarrow Ac. The resultant Schr\"odinger equation becomes a finite-difference equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum. The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of "rational" fields is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an "irrational" field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features, it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies. It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new type of magnetic "superlattice" is introduced, constructed so that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites. Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model, whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a discrete set of points. A method for investigating these predictions experimentally is sketched., This article appears in the following collection:},

The interlayer twist gives rise to a moir\'e superlattice that affects the electronic motion and alters the band structure1\textendash 4. Near a `magic angle' of twist2,4, where the emergence of a flat band causes the charge carriers to slow down3, correlated electronic phases including Mott-like insulators and superconductors were recently discovered5\textendash 8 by using electronic transport. These measurements revealed an intriguing similarity between magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and high-temperature superconductors, which spurred intensive research into the underlying physical mechanism9\textendash 14. Essential clues to this puzzle, such as the symmetry and spatial distribution of the spectral function, can be accessed through scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy to visualize the local density of states and charge distribution in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Doping the sample to partially fill the flat band, we observe a pseudogap phase accompanied by a global stripe charge order that breaks the rotational symmetry of the moir\'e superlattice. Both the pseudogap and the stripe charge order disappear when the band is either empty or full. The close resemblance to similar observations in high-temperature superconductors15\textendash 21 provides new evidence of a deeper link underlying the phenomenology of these systems.},

  abstract = {We use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to study the correlated electron states favored by the Coulomb interaction projected onto the narrow bands of twisted bilayer graphene within a spinless one-valley model. The Hilbert space of the narrow bands is constructed from a pair of hybrid Wannier states with opposite Chern numbers, maximally localized in one direction and Bloch extended in another direction. Depending on the parameters in the Bistritzer-Macdonald model, the DMRG in this basis determines the ground state at one particle per unit cell to be either the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state or a state with zero Hall conductivity which is nearly a product state. Based on this form, we then apply the variational method to study their competition, thus identifying three states: the QAH, a gapless C2T-symmetric nematic, and a gapped C2T-symmetric stripe. In the chiral limit, the energies of the two C2T-symmetric states are found to be significantly above the energy of the QAH. However, all three states are nearly degenerate at the realistic parameters of the Bistritzer-Macdonald model.

  abstract = {We use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to study the correlated electron states favored by the Coulomb interaction projected onto the narrow bands of twisted bilayer graphene within a spinless one-valley model. The Hilbert space of the narrow bands is constructed from a pair of hybrid Wannier states with opposite Chern numbers, maximally localized in one direction and Bloch extended in another direction. Depending on the parameters in the Bistritzer-Macdonald model, the DMRG in this basis determines the ground state at one particle per unit cell to be either the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state or a state with zero Hall conductivity which is nearly a product state. Based on this form, we then apply the variational method to study their competition, thus identifying three states: the QAH, a gapless C2T-symmetric nematic, and a gapped C2T-symmetric stripe. In the chiral limit, the energies of the two C2T-symmetric states are found to be significantly above the energy of the QAH. However, all three states are nearly degenerate at the realistic parameters of the Bistritzer-Macdonald model. The single-particle spectrum of the nematic contains either a quadratic node or two close Dirac nodes near {$\Gamma$}. Motivated by the Landau level degeneracy found in this state, we propose it to be the state observed at the charge neutrality point once spin and valley degeneracies are restored.

  abstract = {The electronic properties of heterostructures of atomically thin van der Waals crystals can be modified substantially by moir\'e superlattice potentials from an interlayer twist between crystals1,2. Moir\'e~tuning of the band structure has led to the recent discovery of superconductivity3,4 and correlated insulating phases5 in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the `magic angle' of twist of about 1.1 degrees, with a phase diagram reminiscent of high-transition-temperature superconductors. Here we directly map the atomic-scale structural and electronic properties of TBG near the magic angle using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. We observe two distinct van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the local density of states around the magic angle, with an energy separation of 57~millielectronvolts that drops to 40~millielectronvolts with high electron/hole doping. Unexpectedly, the VHS energy separation continues to decrease with decreasing twist angle, with a lowest value of 7 to 13 millielectronvolts at a magic angle of 0.79 degrees. More crucial to the correlated behaviour of this material, we find that at the magic angle, the ratio of the Coulomb interaction to the bandwidth of each individual VHS (U/t) is maximized, which is optimal for electronic Cooper pairing mechanisms. When doped near the half-moir\'e-band filling, a correlation-induced gap splits the conduction VHS with a maximum size of 6.5 millielectronvolts at 1.15 degrees, dropping to 4 millielectronvolts at 0.79 degrees. We capture the doping-dependent and angle-dependent spectroscopy results using a Hartree\textendash Fock model, which allows us to extract the on-site and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions. This analysis yields a U/t of order unity indicating that magic-angle TBG is moderately correlated. In addition, scanning tunnelling spectroscopy maps reveal an energy- and doping-dependent three-fold rotational-symmetry breaking of the local density of states in TBG, with the strongest symmetry breaking near the Fermi level and further enhanced when doped to the correlated gap regime. This indicates the presence of a strong electronic nematic susceptibility or even nematic order in TBG in regions of the phase diagram where superconductivity is observed.},

Restricting the search to orders for which the valley U(1) symmetry remains unbroken, we find three types of self-consistent solutions with competitive ground-state energy (i) insulators that break C2T symmetry, including valley Chern insulators; (ii) spin- or valley-polarized insulators; and (iii) rotation C3 symmetry-breaking semimetals the gaplessness of which is protected by the topology of the moir\'e flat bands. We find that the relative stability of these states can be tuned by weak strains that break C3 rotation. The nematic semimetal and also, somewhat unexpectedly, the C2T breaking insulators are stabilized by weak strain. These ground states may be related to the semimetallic and insulating behaviors seen at charge neutrality, and the sample variability of their observation. We also compare with the results of scanning tunneling microscopy measurements near charge neutrality.},

  abstract = {Ferromagnetism and superconductivity typically compete with each other since the internal magnetic field generated in a magnet suppresses the formation of spin-singlet Cooper pairs in conventional superconductors. Only a handful of ferromagnetic superconductors are known in heavy fermion systems, where many-body electron interactions promoted by the narrow energy bands play a key role in stabilizing these emergent states. Recently, interaction-driven superconductivity and ferromagnetism have been demonstrated as separate phenomena in different density regimes of flat bands enabled by graphene moire superlattices. Combining superconductivity and magnetism in a single ground state may lead to more exotic quantum phases. Here, employing van der Waals heterostructures of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG), we realize a flat electron band that is tunable by perpendicular electric fields. Similar to the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, TDBG exhibits energy gaps at the half and quarter filled flat bands, indicating the emergence of correlated insulating states. We find that the gaps of these insulating states increase with in-plane magnetic field, suggesting a ferromagnetic order. Upon doping the ferromagnetic half-filled insulator, superconductivity emerges with a critical temperature controlled by both density and electric fields. We observe that the in-plane magnetic field enhances the superconductivity in the low field regime, suggesting spin-polarized electron pairing. Spin-polarized superconducting states discovered in TDBG provide a new route to engineering interaction-driven topological superconductivity.},

In weak magnetic fields, the low-energy conduction band is quantized into electronlike and holelike Landau levels at energies below and above the van Hove singularity, respectively, and the Hall conductivity sharply drops from positive to negative when the Fermi energy goes through the transition point. In increasing magnetic field, the spectrum gradually evolves into a fractal band structure called Hofstadter's butterfly, where the Hall conductivity exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of Fermi energy. The typical electron density and magnetic field amplitude characterizing the spectrum monotonically decrease as the rotation angle is reduced, indicating that the rich electronic structure may be observed in a moderate condition.},

  abstract = {The interplay between strong electron-electron interactions and band topology can lead to novel electronic states that spontaneously break symmetries. The discovery of flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) with nontrivial topology has provided a unique platform in which to search for new symmetry-broken phases. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy and transport experiments have revealed a sequence of topological insulating phases in MATBG with Chern numbers \$C=\textbackslash pm 3, \textbackslash, \textbackslash pm 2, \textbackslash, \textbackslash pm 1\$ near moir\textbackslash 'e band filling factors \$\textbackslash nu = \textbackslash pm 1, \textbackslash, \textbackslash pm 2, \textbackslash, \textbackslash pm 3\$, corresponding to a simple pattern of flavor-symmetry-breaking Chern insulators. Here, we report high-resolution local compressibility measurements of MATBG with a scanning single electron transistor that reveal a new sequence of incompressible states with unexpected Chern numbers observed down to zero magnetic field. We find that the Chern numbers for eight of the observed incompressible states are incompatible with the simple picture in which the \$C= \textbackslash pm 1\$ bands are sequentially filled. We show that the emergence of these unusual incompressible phases can be understood as a consequence of broken translation symmetry that doubles the moir\textbackslash 'e unit cell and splits each \$C=\textbackslash pm 1\$ band into a \$C=\textbackslash pm 1\$ band and a \$C=0\$ band. Our findings significantly expand the known phase diagram of MATBG, and shed light onto the origin of the close competition between different correlated phases in the system.},

Here we report electrical transport measurements up to room temperature for twist angles varying between 0.75\textdegree{} and 2\textdegree. We find that the resistivity, {$\rho$}, scales linearly with temperature, T, over a wide range of T before falling again owing to interband activation. The T-linear response is much larger than observed in monolayer graphene for all measured devices, and in particular increases by more than three orders of magnitude in the range where the flat band exists. Our results point to the dominant role of electron\textendash phonon scattering in twisted bilayer graphene, with possible implications for the origin of the observed superconductivity.},

As the d-density wave condensation strength is tuned the spectrum evolves through three topologically distinct butterflies, and a relativistic quantum Hall effect is observed. The chiral p+ip-density wave state demonstrates drastically different Hofstadter physics\textemdash inducing a destruction of the gaps in the butterfly which causes electrons' cyclotron orbits to not obey any type of Landau quantization, and the creation of a large gap in the spectrum with Hall conductance {$\sigma$}xy=0. To investigate the quantum phases in the system we perform a multifractal analysis of the single particle wave functions. We find that tuning the d-density wave strength at a generic value of magnetic flux controls a metal-metal transition at charge neutrality where the wave-function multifractality occurs at energy level crossings. In the p+ip case we observe another metal-metal transition occurring at an energy level crossing separated by a strongly multifractal quasi-insulating island state occurring at charge neutrality and strip dimerization of the lattice.},

At integer fillings of these flat bands, energy gaps due to strong electron-electron interactions are generally observed. However, the presence of other correlation-driven phases in twisted graphitic systems at non-integer fillings is unclear. Here, we report scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements that reveal the existence of threefold rotational (C3) symmetry breaking in twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBG). Using spectroscopic imaging over large and uniform areas to characterize the direction and degree of C3 symmetry breaking, we find it to be prominent only at energies corresponding to the flat bands and nearly absent in the remote bands. We demonstrate that the C3 symmetry breaking cannot be explained by heterostrain or the displacement field, and is instead a manifestation of an interaction-driven electronic nematic phase, which emerges even away from integer fillings. Comparing our experimental data with a combination of microscopic and phenomenological modeling, we show that the nematic instability is not associated with the local scale of the graphene lattice, but is an emergent phenomenon at the scale of the moir\textbackslash 'e lattice, pointing to the universal character of this ordered state in flat band moir\textbackslash 'e materials.},

  abstract = {In bilayer graphene rotationally faulted to theta=1.1 degrees, interlayer tunneling and rotational misalignment conspire to create a pair of low energy flat band that have been found to host various correlated phenomena at partial filling. Most work to date has focused on the zero magnetic field phase diagram, with magnetic field (B) used as a probe of the B=0 band structure. Here, we show that twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) in a B as low as 2T hosts a cascade of ferromagnetic Chern insulators with Chern number |C|=1,2 and 3. We argue that the emergence of the Chern insulators is driven by the interplay of the moire superlattice with the B, which endow the flat bands with a substructure of topologically nontrivial subbands characteristic of the Hofstadter butterfly. The new phases can be accounted for in a Stoner picture in which exchange interactions favor polarization into one or more spin- and valley-isospin flavors; in contrast to conventional quantum Hall ferromagnets, however, electrons polarize into between one and four copies of a single Hofstadter subband with Chern number C=-1. In the case of the C=\textbackslash pm3 insulators in particular, B catalyzes a first order phase transition from the spin- and valley-unpolarized B=0 state into the ferromagnetic state. Distinct from other moire heterostructures, tBLG realizes the strong-lattice limit of the Hofstadter problem and hosts Coulomb interactions that are comparable to the full bandwidth W and are consequently much stronger than the width of the individual Hofstadter subbands. In our experimental data, the dominance of Coulomb interactions manifests through the appearance of Chern insulating states with spontaneously broken superlattice symmetry at half filling of a C=-2 subband. Our experiments show that that tBLG may be an ideal venue to explore the strong interaction limit within partially filled Hofstadter bands.},

The proximity of superconductivity to correlated insulators suggested a close relationship between these states, reminiscent of the cuprates where superconductivity arises by doping a Mott insulator. Here, we show that superconductivity can appear far away from the correlated insulating states. Although both superconductivity and correlated insulating behaviour are strongest near the flat-band condition, superconductivity survives to larger detuning of the angle. Our observations are consistent with a `competing phases' picture in which insulators and superconductivity arise from different mechanisms.},

  abstract = {In condensed-matter systems, higher temperatures typically disfavour ordered phases, leading to an upper critical temperature for magnetism, superconductivity and other phenomena. An exception is the Pomeranchuk effect in 3He, in which the liquid ground state freezes upon increasing the temperature1, owing to the large entropy of the paramagnetic solid phase. Here we show that a similar mechanism describes the finite-temperature dynamics of spin and valley isospins in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene2. Notably, a resistivity peak appears at high temperatures near a superlattice filling factor of~-1, despite no signs of a commensurate correlated phase appearing in the low-temperature limit. Tilted-field magnetotransport and thermodynamic measurements of the in-plane magnetic moment show that the resistivity peak is connected to a finite-field magnetic phase transition3 at which the system develops finite isospin polarization. These data are suggestive of a Pomeranchuk-type mechanism, in which the entropy of disordered isospin moments in the ferromagnetic phase stabilizes the phase relative to an isospin-unpolarized Fermi liquid phase at higher temperatures. We find the entropy, in units of Boltzmann's constant, to be of the order of unity per unit cell area, with a measurable fraction that is suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field consistent with a contribution from disordered spins. In contrast to 3He, however, no discontinuities are observed in the thermodynamic quantities across this transition. Our findings imply a small isospin stiffness4,5, with implications for the nature of finite-temperature electron transport6\textendash 8, as well as for the mechanisms underlying isospin ordering and superconductivity9,10 in twisted bilayer graphene and related systems.},

  abstract = {Graphene-based moir\textbackslash '\{e\} systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years as they display a remarkable variety of correlated phenomena. Besides insulating and superconducting phases in the vicinity of integer fillings of the moir\textbackslash '\{e\} unit cell, there is growing evidence for electronic nematic order both in twisted bilayer graphene and twisted double-bilayer graphene (tDBG), as signaled by the spontaneous breaking of the threefold rotational symmetry of the moir\textbackslash '\{e\} superlattices. Here, we combine symmetry-based analysis with a microscopic continuum model to investigate the structure of the nematic phase of tDBG and its experimental manifestations. First, we perform a detailed comparison between the theoretically calculated local density of states and recent scanning tunneling microscopy data [arXiv:2009.11645] to resolve the internal structure of the nematic order parameter in terms of the layer, sublattice, spin, and valley degrees of freedom. We find strong evidence that the dominant contribution to the nematic order parameter comes from states at the moir\textbackslash '\{e\} scale rather than at the microscopic scale of the individual graphene layers, which demonstrates the key role played by the moir\textbackslash 'e degrees of freedom and confirms the correlated nature of the nematic phase in tDBG. Secondly, our analysis reveals an unprecedented tunability of the orientation of the nematic director in tDBG by an externally applied electric field, allowing the director to rotate away from high-symmetry crystalline directions. We compute the expected fingerprints of this rotation in both STM and transport experiments, providing feasible ways to probe it. Rooted in the strong sensitivity of the flat bands of tDBG to the displacement field, this effect opens an interesting route to the electrostatic control of electronic nematicity in moir\textbackslash '\{e\} systems.},

  abstract = {The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is sometimes observed in twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) when it is nearly aligned with an encapsulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layer. We propose that the appearance or absence of the QAH effect in individual devices could be related to commensurability between the graphene/graphene and graphene/hBN moir\'e patterns. We identify a series of points in the (\texttheta GG,\texttheta GBN) twist-angle space at which the two moir\'e patterns are commensurate, allowing moir\'e band theory to be applied, and we show that the band Chern numbers are in this case sensitive to a rigid in-plane hBN displacement. Given this property, we argue that the QAH effect is likely only when (i) the (\texttheta GG,\texttheta GBN) twist-angle-pair is close enough to a commensurate point that the two moir\'e patterns yield a supermoir\'e pattern with a sufficiently long length scale, and (ii) the supermoir\'e has a percolating topologically nontrivial QAH phase. For twist angles far from commensurability, the hBN layer acts as a source of disorder that can destroy the QAH effect. Our proposal can explain a number of current experimental observations. Further experimental studies that can test this proposal more directly are suggested.},

Spanton et al. describe a class of related but even more unusual states, the fractional Chern insulators (see the Perspective by Repellin and Regnault). They observed these states in samples of bilayer graphene, where one of the graphene layers was misaligned by a small angle with respect to an adjoining layer of hexagonal boron nitride. The misalignment created a superlattice potential and topologically nontrivial bands, which had a fractional filling, thanks to strong electronic interactions. The findings expand the class of correlated topological states, which have been predicted to harbor exotic excitations. Science, this issue p. 62; see also p. 31 Topologically ordered phases are characterized by long-range quantum entanglement and fractional statistics rather than by symmetry breaking. First observed in a fractionally filled continuum Landau level, topological order has since been proposed to arise more generally at fractional fillings of topologically nontrivial Chern bands.

  abstract = {The recent discovery of superconducting and correlated insulating states coexisting in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MAG) at commensurate fillings have raised fascinating questions about the interplay of these orders. Tuning electron-electron inter-actions in MAG would shed light on the individual roles of these phases and their intri-cate relationship. Here we report on a new method to control electronic interactions in a correlated system, by varying the separation of a metallic screening layer in ultra-close proximity to a MAG layer. We observe that correlated insulators disappear when the separation becomes smaller than the extent of Wannier orbitals, w {$<$} 15nm, consistent with the expected screening of Coulomb interactions. The superconducting phase re-mains resilient under screening, taking over the phase space vacated by correlated insu-lators and showing critical temperatures comparable to those in unscreened devices. However, even under screening, correlated insulators reappear at half-filling upon applying small out-of-plane magnetic field {$>$} 0.5 tesla, exhibiting Chern bands with quan-tized Hall resistance of h/2e2 consistent with orbital magnetism. Our study establishes direct and independent control of the insulating and superconducting phases, pointing to their possibly distinct microscopic origin. The re-examination of the often-assumed mother-child relation between these phases, triggered by these observations, illustrates a new technique to directly probe microscopic mechanisms of anomalous superconductivity in MAG and other strongly-correlated systems.},

Of particular interest is when the two crystals closely match and a moir\'e pattern forms, resulting in modified electronic and excitonic spectra, crystal reconstruction, and more. Thus, moir\'e patterns are a viable tool for controlling the properties of 2D materials. However, the difference in periodicity of the two crystals limits the reconstruction and, thus, is a barrier to the low-energy regime. Here, we present a route to spectrum reconstruction at all energies. By using graphene which is aligned to two hexagonal boron nitride layers, one can make electrons scatter in the differential moir\'e pattern which results in spectral changes at arbitrarily low energies. Further, we demonstrate that the strength of this potential relies crucially on the atomic reconstruction of graphene within the differential moir\'e super cell.},

Understanding the microscopic mechanisms responsible for these phases requires determination of the interplay between electron\textendash electron interactions and quantum degeneracy (the latter is due to spin and valley degrees of freedom). Signatures of strong electron\textendash electron correlations have been observed at partial fillings of the flat electronic bands in recent spectroscopic measurements7\textendash 10, and transport experiments have shown changes in the Landau level degeneracy at fillings corresponding to an integer number of electrons per moir\'e unit cell2\textendash 4. However, the interplay between interaction effects and the degeneracy of the system is currently unclear. Here we report a cascade of transitions in the spectroscopic properties of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene as a function of electron filling, determined using high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy. We find distinct changes in the chemical potential and a rearrangement of the low-energy excitations at each integer filling of the moir\'e flat bands. These spectroscopic features are a direct consequence of Coulomb interactions, which split the degenerate flat bands into Hubbard sub-bands. We find these interactions, the strength of which we can extract experimentally, to be surprisingly sensitive to the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, which strongly modifies the spectroscopic transitions. The cascade of transitions that~we report here characterizes the correlated high-temperature parent phase11,12 from which various insulating and superconducting ground-state phases emerge at low temperatures in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.},

  abstract = {Control of the interlayer twist angle in two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures enables one to engineer a quasiperiodic moir\'e superlattice of tunable length scale1\textendash 8. In twisted bilayer graphene, the simple moir\'e superlattice band description suggests that the electronic bandwidth can be tuned to be comparable to the vdW interlayer interaction at a `magic angle'9, exhibiting strongly correlated behaviour. However, the vdW interlayer interaction can also cause significant structural reconstruction at the interface by favouring interlayer commensurability, which competes with the intralayer lattice distortion10\textendash 16. Here we report atomic-scale reconstruction in twisted bilayer graphene and its effect on the electronic structure. We find a gradual transition from an incommensurate moir\'e structure to an array of commensurate domains with soliton boundaries as we decrease the twist angle across the characteristic crossover angle, \texttheta c\,{$\approx$}\,1\textdegree. In the solitonic regime (\texttheta\,{$<$}\,\texttheta c) where the atomic and electronic reconstruction become significant, a simple moir\'e band description breaks down and the secondary Dirac bands appear. On applying a transverse electric field, we observe electronic transport along the network of one-dimensional topological channels that surround the alternating triangular gapped domains. Atomic and electronic reconstruction at the vdW interface provide a new pathway to engineer the system with continuous tunability.},

This degeneracy lifting has been reproduced in experiments by multiple groups and is known to occur even in devices which do not harbor the correlated insulators and superconductors. We propose C3-symmetry breaking as an explanation of such robust degeneracy lifting and support our proposal by numerical results on the Landau-level spectrum in near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Motivated by recent experiments, we further consider the effect of C2-symmetry breaking on the Landau levels.},

Extremely large EMR values, \$MR=(R(B) - R\_0) / R\_0\textbackslash sim 10\^5\$, are achieved in part because \$R\_0\$ approaches or crosses zero as a function of the gate voltage, exceeding that achieved in high mobility bulk semiconductor devices. We highlight the sensitivity, \$dR/dB\$, which in two-terminal measurements is the highest yet reported for EMR devices, and in particular exceeds prior results in graphene-based devices by a factor of 20. An asymmetry in the zero-field transport is traced to the presence of \$pn\$-junctions at the graphene-metal shunt interface.},

  abstract = {Twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle1\textendash 4 exhibits rich electron-correlation physics, displaying insulating3\textendash 6, magnetic7,8 and superconducting phases4\textendash 6. The electronic bands of this system were predicted1,2 to narrow markedly9,10 near the magic angle, leading to a variety of possible symmetry-breaking ground states11\textendash 17. Here, using measurements of the local electronic compressibility, we show that these correlated phases originate from a high-energy state with an unusual sequence of band population. As carriers are added to the system, the four electronic `flavours', which correspond to the spin and valley degrees of freedom, are not filled equally. Rather, they are populated through a sequence of sharp phase transitions, which appear as strong asymmetric jumps of the electronic compressibility near integer fillings of the moir\'e lattice. At each transition, a single spin/valley flavour takes all the carriers from its partially filled peers, `resetting' them to the vicinity of the charge neutrality point. As a result, the Dirac-like character observed near charge neutrality reappears after each integer filling. Measurement of the in-plane magnetic field dependence of the chemical potential near filling factor one reveals a large spontaneous magnetization, further substantiating this picture of a cascade of symmetry breaking. The sequence of phase transitions and Dirac revivals is observed at temperatures well above the onset of the superconducting and correlated insulating states. This indicates that the state that~we report here, with its strongly broken electronic flavour symmetry and revived Dirac-like electronic character, is important in the physics of magic-angle graphene, forming the parent state out of which the more fragile superconducting and correlated insulating ground states emerge.},

  abstract = {A remarkable feature of the band structure of bilayer graphene at small twist angle is the appearance of isolated bands near neutrality, whose bandwidth can be reduced at certain magic angles (e.g., \texttheta{$\sim$}1.05{$\circ$}). In this regime, correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been experimentally observed. A microscopic description of these phenomena requires an understanding of universal aspects of the band structure, which we discuss here. First, we point out the importance of emergent symmetries, such as valley conservation, which are excellent symmetries in the limit of small twist angles and dictate qualitative features of the band structure. These have sometimes been overlooked when discussing commensurate approximants to the band structure, which we also review here, and solidify their connection with the continuum theory which incorporates all emergent symmetries. Finally, we discuss obstructions to writing tight-binding models of just the isolated bands, and in particular a symmetry-based diagnostic of these obstructions, as well as relations to band topology and strategies for resolving the obstruction. Especially, we construct a four-band model where the two lower isolated bands realize all identified Wannier obstructions of the single-valley nearly flat bands of twisted bilayer graphene.},
